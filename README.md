# Description of this Repository 

Within this repository you will find the submission for my 2022 Programming for Data Analysis Project for the Atlantic Technological University. This project aims to explore the datasets available for global cancer incidences.

# To Run this project  

- Download the repository from GitHub by selecting download zip from the drop-down menu in the green code box, visible on the repository.  

- Ensure jupyter Notebook is setup on your device information on how to download is available here: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-in-windows/ 

- Unzip the downloaded file.  

- In the terminal navigate to the directory that contains the downloaded files and type “jupyter notebook”.  

- Once jupyter notebook is open select a notebook and run it.

## Structure of the layout: 

In addition to the research into the topic documented within the Jupyter notebook pages extensive research was also done into how to best write and format the code. Particular attention was given to the SOLID principles of coding and the clean code practices. Refer to references page for sources.

Within this repository you should find: 

1. SetUp: This folder contains the necessary code to run the project. A conscious decision was made not to put the functions/references/packages directly into the jupyyter Notebooks to best adhere to the following clean code practices - DRY ('Don't Repeat Yourself), and S - Single Responsibility, from the S.O.L.I.D principles.  

- Functions - File containing functions that can be used across multiple jupyter notebooks.  
<<<<<<< HEAD
- PackageInstall - containing the necessary python packages to run the code.  
- References - Contains a list of all the references used throughout research project and an appropriate function to ensure the references are appended to the correct notebook.  

2. Jupyter Notebooks - Divided out into a Start, Middle, and End. Labeled in the ascending order to which they should be ran in the following Order (1-3): 

- 1_GlobalCancers_TrendsInFrequency 
- 2_BreastCancer_TrendsInBenignAndMalignantCells 
- 3_SimulatedCaseStudy

## Idea Behind the Project  

Initially this project was aimed at researching the potential for hydraulic energy in Ireland, to evaluate the current structure and calculate cost savings (if any) when compared to the more dominantly used fossil fuel while also comparing the environmental impact. Though there were some datasets available that initially sparked an interest, the efforts were in vain (on this occasion at least) as there were limited resources to support and compare the datasets.  

The direction of the project shifted towards healthcare and one topic stood out amongst the rest for its extensive research and access to datasets, that being, the study of cancer.  

To further advance this project I would have liked to advance the project by adding additional trends around machine learning and predictability.
