Note: This draft will be combined into a Jupyter notebook for final submission. 

Goal of the project is to synthesis a dataset - my taking from this to come up with a project that answers a fundamental question using a variaety of differnt data sources to display trending resutls. 

Concept 1: 
There is an argument that by 2025 machines will be a billion times smarter than humans. 
That Human inteligence is capped - we as a species have the inteilgence to provide a way to heat our homes, create means of transport, provide seasonal produce all year round in our local gorcery stores but all this, at the determent to our planet. 

We have not yet found a way to support the modern ways of the world in a sustainable fashion. The need for an alternative energy source has become blatently obvious within the last year alone. Following the attacks the Russian government has led on Ukraine an energy crisis is very much on our doorstep with fuel prices at an all time high. 

This project will look at the following:
Current state:
- Show the trends of energy crisis - current state
- Show the amount of sustainable energy ireland produces in comparision to world - Current state 

Case Study:
- potential hydro energy in Ireland 
- costs of implementing the hydro energy 
- comparision with another country 
- Savings for the irish people 
- Impact on marine life 

Research:
